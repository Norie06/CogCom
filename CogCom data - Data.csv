3,26,Male,9,"I think, if people look around they are trying to recall memories. Making it more trustworthy",1,Up,On
3,26,Male,6,I don't know. She keeps looking down which is weird,2,Down,Off

3,26,Male,9,"Her looking up and then into the camera, seems like she is trying to remember things and then when she remembers them she tells them to the camera. I see that as a person who is telling the Truth",4,Up,Off

5,22,Female,3,"The face mask and she was looking away a lot, not really having eye contact.",1,Up,On

5,22,Female,8,"It was quite reliable, she was short and consice.",3,Down,On
5,22,Female,5,"Shes looking away quite a lot, but it looks like it was a distressing story, so maybe that could be the reason. Because you cant hear her, its hard to know if shes taking breaks to think about the story/backtracking.",4,Up,Off

10,20,Female,8,I do not see any reason why the person would lie about such an event,1,Up,On
10,20,Female,6,"The person was avoiding eye contact by looking down, which feels much more avoidant than just shy (when a person cannot hold eye contact because of that)",2,Down,Off
10,20,Female,8,"I do not see a reason why she would lie about that, the looking down in this context feels more like recollecting her thoughts and just getting over her low self-esteeem when it comes to singing",3,Down,On
10,20,Female,10,"she seems very excited and just into that story she is telling, does not seem all that suspicious",4,Up,Off
11,23,Male,3,"Looking around anxiously, looking up and to the side and breaking eye contact a lot. She speaks inconsistently and she sounds unsure of her story",1,Up,On
11,23,Male,1,"Not holding eye contact.  Blinking a lot, looking down and looking ashamed, possibly from not telling the truth",2,Down,Off
11,23,Male,9,Healthy amount of eye contact and consistency of speech made me think she is telling the truth,3,Down,On
11,23,Male,10,She has the look of genuine excitement in her eyes and expressions while she is telling the story. She is probably not lying.,4,Up,Off

12,23,Female,7,"Seems to be sure of hersef, no unnecessary moving, her eyes look at the same place as if she was remebering something",2,Down,Off

13,34,Female,3,She seemed like she has to think a lot and in the end he looked quite insecure,4,Up,Off
14,32,Female,5,You cant jugde another person to be trust worthy or not from a video wearing a mask you cant see half of the face but thats maybe the point,1,Up,On

14,32,Female,5,"The previous comments, cant call judgement without knowing the person better, seeing the body language and a new reason i have issues calling judgement cant feel the vibe the person is giving, im a person who feels vibes and feeling from others when entering a room",3,Down,On

17,21,Female,5,"Very frequently looked down, like she would want to shield herself, although her demeanor felt bit more full of emotions, bit more raw",3,Down,Off
17,21,Female,3,"So again, the frequent looking down is a bi sus. Also, the content of the story does not require one to be so emotionally sad and withdrawn, scared almost, which is making it more suspicious.",4,Down,On
18,21,Male,9,"The face mask makes her seem like either a clinical worker (who I generally find trustworthy) or someone ill choosing to wear a mask to protect others, which makes her seem caring and respectful.",1,Up,Off
18,21,Male,2,"The story sounds unlikely and the story only serves to make her seem great which is very suspicious. Also, all details are about how she is great - I could only think ""yeah, right"".",2,Up,On
18,21,Male,7,"The face mask makes her seem trustworthy and I can't see her face move, so I can't judge based on that. But I trust her less after the previous video.",3,Down,Off
18,21,Male,9,"It sounds like a probable story that is even a bit embarrassing for the speaker, the only thing she could get out of telling the story is sharing a funny story, which makes it sounds trustworthy.",4,Down,On
19,22,Male,5,I cant determine a good answer on the present ques,1,Up,Off
19,22,Male,3,It sounds scripted/rehearsed,2,Up,On
19,22,Male,5,The cues could be intepretted both ways,3,Down,Off
19,22,Male,3,The breaks in between the sentences felt unnattural and the person looked down a lot,4,Down,On
20,22,Female,3,"Little eye contact, and why is she wearing a mask haha",1,Up,Off
20,22,Female,8,There is way to little detail and feeling in the telling of a relative intense event. Not much eye contact,2,Up,On
20,22,Female,7,It seems serious what she is saying. The eyes look down a lot and it feels like there is some sort of true shock og wondering related to it,3,Down,Off
20,22,Female,8,"A sense of both openness and shyness in the approach, which makes her seem reliable",4,Down,On
21,22,Female,8,She looked up with her eyes. It looks like she is remembering.,1,Up,Off
21,22,Female,6,I do not know. It seems like she tries to display herself as a hero.,2,Up,On

21,22,Female,10,,4,Down,On
22,28,Male,2,They could say whatever when I can’t hear it,1,Up,Off
22,28,Male,7,Now that I can hear her it’s more trustworthy but there’s still something about it that is a bit fishy,2,Up,On
22,28,Male,1,No eye contact and no sound seems suspicious,3,Down,Off
22,28,Male,7,It’s still a bit more trustworthy but again the eye contact thing is a bit suspicious,4,Down,On
23,19,Female,4,,1,Up,Off
23,19,Female,6,,2,Up,On
23,19,Female,3,,3,Down,Off
23,19,Female,2,,4,Down,On
24,19,Male,5,Somewhat shows emotion in her expressions,1,Up,Off
24,19,Male,3,Story doesn’t seem to add up completely. The kids mom would have been closer and more likely to save her kid.,2,Up,On
24,19,Male,6,"Expressions seem more relaxed, and not overdone unlike the previous video.",3,Down,Off
24,19,Male,2,"Again the story doesn’t add up. She went to a cafe with clear intentions to buy one thing, but got another, despite the cashier understanding her communication flawlessly.",4,Down,On
25,19,Female,4,The constant breaking of eye contact and turning the head away.,1,Up,Off
25,19,Female,2,The tone of the person's voice and how they were trying to sound almost heroic.,2,Up,On
25,19,Female,8,"They are blinking slowly and only breaking the eye contact with quick glances downwards, which gives me the impression that they are recalling the story that has happened to them. Their head is also fixed, they are not trying to compensate the lying with other actions/movements.",3,Down,Off
25,19,Female,10,Their way of getting into the details seems very honest and the pauses in between the words or phrases makes me think that they are trying to explain the story the best.,4,Down,On
26,18,Female,10,"Seems like a credible story, not something people lie about.",1,Up,Off
26,18,Female,8,Based on the person it could be a lie and it’s not something that just happens to prople either but there’s a possibility that she could be telling the truth.,2,Up,On
26,18,Female,4,Normally if there was sound I wouldn’t notice but she looks down a lot which can me an indication she’s not telling the truth.,3,Down,Off
26,18,Female,8,"Simple enough story that I would believe.
(This is unrelated but I am autistic and i wanted to let you know in case i no longer fit the criteria to take the test because of this)",4,Down,On
27,26,Female,4,Looking away a lot,1,Up,Off
27,26,Female,3,Seems exaggerated,2,Up,On
27,26,Female,8,Doesn't look away,3,Down,Off
27,26,Female,9,"Hard to say, just a feeling",4,Down,On
28,44,Female,9,"Look up often, mimic",1,Up,Off
28,44,Female,5,"True or not, the lifesaving story is hearttouching, but I’m not sure it happend the way exactly",2,Up,On
28,44,Female,9,"Her face and mimic seems to me honest and full of sad emotions, maybe she speaks about deep and meaningfull toughts",3,Down,Off
28,44,Female,2,"Because she can’t speak good enough danish to order a simple coffee for herself. But she seems to me opinionated a little bit about her pronunciation, but its not the point, more the final result (to order what I want)",4,Down,On
29,21,Male,2,Looks down a lot and people does not usually give compliments to people for knowing a city,1,Down,On
29,21,Male,10,Seems genuine in presentation. Looks up to think as if she has nothing to hide,2,Up,Off
29,21,Male,7,Could definitely happen that a guy hits on a girl by telling them the sing well on a kareokee bar,3,Up,On
29,21,Male,1,Minimal bodymovements as well as looking down,4,Down,Off
30,20,Female,5,"Eye movement led me to believe that it was a little exaggerated, but not completely a lie",1,Down,On
30,20,Female,8,Facial expressions seemed real,2,Up,Off
30,20,Female,9,Honest personal opinion,3,Up,On
30,20,Female,4,Not a lot of eye contact,4,Down,Off
31,18,Female,7,She seemed unsure with the story and the mask made it awkward to read her emotions,1,Down,On
31,18,Female,5,Kept looking away,2,Up,Off
31,18,Female,6,The story seems made up,3,Up,On
31,18,Female,4,She keeps looking down like she’s reading,4,Down,Off
32,20,Male,5,Not seeing mimics.,1,Down,On
32,20,Male,7,I can focus more on the eyes.,2,Up,Off
32,20,Male,4,Tone.,3,Up,On
32,20,Male,4,Looking down a lot.,4,Down,Off
33,20,Male,2,"- The story itself seems plausible, but is phrased awkwardly and scripted.
- The medical mask that covers much of the speaker's facial expression makes the speaker less trustworthy.
- The speaker seems generally nervous and seems to be stalling with filler words such as ""uh"" and ""um"".
- The delivery sounds practiced.",1,Down,On
33,20,Male,8,"- The medical mask that covers much of the speaker's facial expression makes the speaker less trustworthy.
- The speaker's eyes look up as if recalling something from memory.
- The speaker seems more expressive in body language - engaged in the story.",2,Up,Off
33,20,Male,7,"- The medical mask that covers much of the speaker's facial expression makes the speaker less trustworthy.
- The story sounds a bit scripted/practiced.
- The speaker's eyes look up as if recalling something from memory.
- The delivery sounds fairly natural.",3,Up,On
33,20,Male,5,"- The medical mask that covers much of the speaker's facial expression makes the speaker less trustworthy.
- The speaker seems hesitant.
- Without audio and context, It's hard to say whether the speaker seems truthful or not.",4,Down,Off
34,19,Female,2,because she kept looking down and looked like she didnt know what she was saying,1,Down,On
34,19,Female,3,"because shes talking with a mask, it doesnt seem very trustworthy",2,Up,Off
34,19,Female,7,"because she wasnt looking at me all time, so that might inducate that shes not saying the truth",3,Up,On
34,19,Female,5,because she seemed friendly,4,Down,Off
35,19,Female,3,the eye movements were weird,1,Down,On
35,19,Female,3,looking up made it seem like she was thinking of what to say next,2,Up,Off
35,19,Female,10,the tone of her voice was trustworthy and her eyes were very engaging,3,Up,On
35,19,Female,5,im torn because she looked a kit in the camera which seems reliable but also often looked down,4,Down,Off
36,18,Male,3,It seems weird that she is wearing a face mask when recording the video (she is presumably alone) and the video recording seems a bit unprofessional.,1,Down,On
36,18,Male,2,"Apart from the face mask, unprofessional recording/editing, I do not really know if it is trustworthy or suspicious if there is not any verbal information to go off.",2,Up,Off
36,18,Male,5,"The volume was loud enough and I understood all the message. It sounds like a personal experience that could have happened, but of course I do not know. She might be exaggerating the events or something (specifically the recommendation of becoming a professional singer),",3,Up,On
36,18,Male,2,"The visual presentation is a bit suspicious, particularly the face mask, the constant reading (something I did not mention before) and the recording of the video. But again, if I have to rate the content of the speech, I have nothing to go off.",4,Down,Off
37,23,Female,4,"The person in the video was constantly looking down. Also, she had to think and made breaks before she gave details about the situation.",1,Down,On
37,23,Female,9,"The face told the story much more than in the previous video (so the expression changed during the video). In addition to that, the person was looking at the camera or up and I noticed more people doing that when they remeber something.",2,Up,Off
37,23,Female,9,"She spoke fluently and looked at the camera. In addition to that, her voice and expression changed during the story (e.g. in the ""I don't think I'm that good').",3,Up,On
37,23,Female,5,I'd say it depends a lot on what the person is saying. The way she constantly looks down gives me the impression that she feels guilty. So either she is confessing something or she feels bad about lying.,4,Down,Off
38,24,Male,4,The speaking rhythm makes it seem as if it is being made up,1,Down,On
38,24,Male,7,Seems quite trustworthy. However a few microexpressions made it seem like it was maybe overexagerrated.,2,Up,Off
38,24,Male,9,The micro expressions make it seem like the person is recollecting as opposed to making the story up.,3,Up,On
38,24,Male,6,"Quite convincing I would say. The lack of expressions make the level of honesty hard to decipher, however it didnt feel that suspcious",4,Down,Off
39,19,Male,2,She is always looking down which is kinda sus,1,Down,On
39,19,Male,6,"Well articulated with the face expressions, but a little bit too much for me which is why the score is in the middle",2,Up,Off
39,19,Male,9,"She is looking around the exact same way i do when thinking back on past events, which signals tonme that she is telling the truth",3,Up,On
39,19,Male,8,"The way she is looking gives a sense of importance, although i dont know the story, i feel like the truth is being said.",4,Down,Off
40,32,Male,3,Arrogant,1,Down,On
40,32,Male,4,Not a warm gaze /eye movement,2,Up,Off
40,32,Male,9,"Humbled, easy going",3,Up,On

42,37,Female,2,Her eyes were looking away,1,Down,On
42,37,Female,9,Her eyes were involved,2,Up,Off
42,37,Female,10,Convincing face expression,3,Up,On
42,37,Female,2,Looking always away,4,Down,Off
43,28,Male,1,The covering of the mouth,1,Down,Off
43,28,Male,2,"Lacking in information, generic story",2,Down,On
43,28,Male,1,Overly dramatic movement,3,Up,Off
43,28,Male,4,Better story,4,Up,On
44,22,Female,7,"The facial expressions you could se, felt ""real"" and had feeling.",1,Down,Off
44,22,Female,9,Facial expressions match with what is being told. So does the voice/pitch,2,Down,On
44,22,Female,4,keeps looking up and away. Little less trustworthy.,3,Up,Off
44,22,Female,5,"Little better than before, but the looking away still makes it less trustworthy.",4,Up,On
45,21,Female,4,"constant eye movement, as if she was not sure about the story herself",1,Down,Off
45,21,Female,5,"no confidence in her voice and still constant eye movement, but more convincing",2,Down,On
45,21,Female,7,"you can feel more confidence and expression of emotions, and her eyes are moving in a way as if she was recalling the story or going through the story in her head",3,Up,Off
45,21,Female,7,the same from before,4,Up,On
46,18,Female,3,"She didn’t really maintain eye contact, didn’t use any hand gestures and from her overall body language she seemed rather reserved and tense, making it questionable whether the story was true or not.",1,Down,Off
46,18,Female,4,"Somehow the tone, intonation and pauses in her speech doesn’t match the severity of this situation that she talks about.",2,Down,On
46,18,Female,8,Her facial expressions were much more significant than in the last video. She moved her eyebrows and squinted her eyes many times. This makes the story appear rather realistic.,3,Up,Off
46,18,Female,9,"This situation is very realistic and likely to happen to her. Also, she seemed more relaxed and speaking from experience.",4,Up,On
47,49,Female,6,Because I can't really judge without hearing the story or seeing a full expression on their face so I would judge that it's unlikely they will be lying but of course possible they are.,1,Down,Off
47,49,Female,5,I am not at all sure this is true mostly because of the delivery but of course this person is not a native english speaker from the sound of it and it could simply be that. Felt the delivery was very stilted. The eye movements are also strange but I believe that isn't always due to a lie and could be that the person is for instance on the autism spectrum.,2,Down,On
47,49,Female,6,"Again looking up and up and to the side, I can't say for sure that is a quantified indicator for sure of lying. As I cannot hear what she is saying I wouldn't like to make a definitely decision on whether or not she is lying.",3,Up,Off
47,49,Female,9,I can't see why anyone would lie about this situation firstly but now with the sound it does sound very much as the person is recalling what happened and so I think it is very trustworthy,4,Up,On
48,24,Female,7,"She’s not looking directly at the camera and looks down which could indicate lying. However, it’s also natural to not maintain eye contact (in this case with camera) the whole time. Wearing a face mask makes it more difficult to assess.",1,Down,Off
48,24,Female,4,It sounds too rehearsed,2,Down,On
48,24,Female,7,"Again she’s not maintaining eye contact with a camera, which is natural but could also be a sign of lying. Looking to the side could indicate that she’s trying to think about what to say.",3,Up,Off
48,24,Female,6,It seems like she’s trying to remember what exactly happened,4,Up,On
49,19,Male,3,"Her wearing a mask was probably the biggest, albeit slightly personally motivated giveaway that she was not trustworthy, because I couldn’t see her full face and thus build a more nuanced image of her character and communication. Secondly, she was reluctant to look into the camera, and this made me think that she was shy or was possibly hiding something. All in all, I couldn’t say that she was lying for sure, just that her body language is a little off for me.",1,Down,Off
49,19,Male,7,"Hearing her voice was more comforting in the sense of building trust, but again, without the mouth visible, i just can’t say i fully trust her story. Her making more “eye” contact with the camera was also a plus.",2,Down,On
49,19,Male,5,"same as the last two, but again, her making eye contact was better for building trust and not being able to hear her intonation was a negative along with pf course the mask",3,Up,Off
49,19,Male,9,"It was a more lighthearted story and thus more believable, and the speakers voice was also very relaxed.",4,Up,On
50,24,Male,5,"Hard to tell although she is not looking straight into the camera, it can be due to stress not because she is lying, we also saw that she was trying to do some expression(watch neck) so it could also be hard for her to tell aout what happend(mayve sth traumatic or very intense) which may also be why she was not looking into camera",1,Down,Off
50,24,Male,8,,2,Down,On
50,24,Male,4,here she avoid the eye contact all the time and trying to distance her self when talking(thats the vibe I get),3,Up,Off
50,24,Male,2,"I feel she is telling the truth but it is very colorized, so it is like a mix",4,Up,On
51,30,Female,3,overexagerated gestures and constant eyes to the ground,1,Down,Off
51,30,Female,7,sound of her voice,2,Down,On

52,26,Female,3,Eyes seem trustworthy,3,Up,Off
52,26,Female,8,Story makes sense,4,Up,On
53,33,Male,3,Too little eye contact and she keeps rolling her eyes too,1,Down,Off
53,33,Male,5,Monotone voice,2,Down,On
53,33,Male,4,She keeps looking away,3,Up,Off
53,33,Male,7,Her tone felt more natural and there were breaks in the speech,4,Up,On
54,38,Female,2,Looking at down and avoiding eye contacts,1,Down,Off
54,38,Female,4,"It seems she was unsure whether she behaves right in the situation, so it seems more believable.",2,Down,On
54,38,Female,5,Eye contacts and looking up,3,Up,Off
54,38,Female,8,Looking more up and have sufficient eye contacts,4,Up,On
